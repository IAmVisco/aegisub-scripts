# Blur and Glow
Forked and bandage edited version of [unanimated's Blur and Glow script](https://unanimated.github.io/ts/scripts-manuals.htm#blurglow). Added an option to fix script breaking on linebreaks with `{\r}` and changed default button for quick Enter slap.

# Line height fix
A script to insert line height/spacing tags based on [this guide](https://www.md-subs.com/line-spacing-in-ssa) in case your font has super weird vertical spacing.
Inserts line break instead of the `@` symbol in the line.

# Clipper
A fork of lyger's and lae's [Clipper](https://github.com/idolactivities/vtuber-things/tree/clipper-v1.0.1/clipper), simplified and modifed to encode the whole video without any sitching but applying .ass color correction.
